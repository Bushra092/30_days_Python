    "## **Python: Errors and Exception Handling**\n",
    "An error is a problem or mistake in a program that prevents it from running correctly or producing the expected output. Errors can occur at different stages of program execution compilation, runtime, or logic implementation and must be identified and fixed for the program to work properly.\n",

    "### 1. **Compile-Time Errors (Syntax Errors)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mistakes in syntax (e.g. missing `:` after `if`)\n",
    "* Misspelled keywords (e.g. `prin` instead of `print`)\n",
    "* Python shows error **before running** the code\n",
    "* üí° *Easiest to identify and fix*\n",

    "### 2. **Logical Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code runs fine, **but gives the wrong output**\n",
    "* Example: `2 + 3` gives `4` ‚Üí incorrect, but no syntax issue\n",
    "* Harder to detect because **program doesn‚Äôt crash**\n",
    "* Usually found during **testing/QA**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. **Runtime Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Occur **while the program is running**\n",
    "* Example: `a / 0` (division by zero)\n",
    "* Code is syntactically correct but **fails during execution**\n",
